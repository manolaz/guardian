# ðŸ”¨ Build executables and run manually

If you want to manually build every component with debug information, then build and run the services and packages in the following sequence: Interfaces, Logger Helper, Message Broker, Logger Service, Auth Service, IPFS, Guardian Service, UI Service, and lastly, the MRV Sender Service. See below for commands.

### Prerequisites for Manual Installation

* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) ,
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
* [Nats](https://nats.io/)

#### Build and start each component

Install, configure and start all the prerequisites, then build and start each component.

#### Services Configuration: 

-  for each of the services create the file `./<service_name>/.env` to do this copy, past and rename  the file `./<service_name>/.env.template` 

   For example:

   in `./guardian-service/.env`:
   ```plaintext
       GUARDIAN_ENV="develop"
   ```

   If need to configure OVERRIDE uncomment the variable in file `./guardian-service/.env`:
   ```plaintext
       OVERRIDE="false" 
   ```

-  configure the file `./<service_name>/configs/.env.<service>.<GUARDIAN_ENV>` file: to do this copy, 
   past and rename the file  `./<service_name>/.env.<service>.template` 

   following previous example:

   in `./guardian-service/configs/.env.guardian.develop`:
   ```plaintext
   OPERATOR_ID="..."
   OPERATOR_KEY="..."
   ```
