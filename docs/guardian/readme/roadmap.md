## ---- August 2023----

### Restore (DR) of user accounts and encrypted documents

* An approach to storing/managing all the keys outside Guardian - in the escrow service or just as a back-up. Export/import tooling.
* Capability to restore user accounts and their associated keys such as to replicate guardian installation
* Guardian restore functionality should use whatever information is available to it to restore its original setup, specifically when user accounts have been restored it should result in the decryption and thus accessibility of the encrypted documents.

### CDM's AMS-III.D. Methodology

* Design schemas for AMS-III.D. methodology, create PowerPoint presentation, and conduct webinar.
*   Schemas will also be designed for the following tools:

    * Tool 03 - Tool to calculate project or leakage CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion
    * Tool 05 - Baseline, project and/or leakage emissions from electricity consumption and monitoring of electricity generation
    * Tool 06 - Project emissions from flaring
    * Tool 16 - Project and leakage emissions from anaerobic digesters

## ---- September 2023----

### Evolution of policy differentiation

* Add comparison of document schemas associated with the policies
* Implement the ability fro Guardian to compare policies without importing them into Guardian (i.e. without it appearing in the various grids etc).
*   Allow for mass-comparison of policies such that a user should be able to search for policies 'similar' to 'different' to some other policy based on some similarity threshold.

    * Ability to pre-process policies creating some data structures (hashes?) to enable more efficient comparison with other policies in the future

## ---- October 2023----

### Contract-based delegation for token retirement operations

Implement an enhancement for the token creation and retirement operation essentially creating contract-managed ACL list of delegate (contract) accounts which can retire tokens. The idea is as follows:

* An SR deploys a smart contract which will be the creator/destroyer of tokens of a particular type. This means that the 'burn' and/or 'wipe' key for the token would belong to this smart contract. The SR adds this key as the wipe key to the token 'definition'.
* This smart contract contains a provision for keeping a map of (contract) account addresses to tokens it controls.
* Each of the 3rd party 'exchange' contract, for each pair, requests an authorization from the 'Manager' smart contracts for performing retirement operations.
* When/if the SR approves such request the 'exchange' smart contract's address gets added tot he 'authorized' map of address-token pairs.
* From this point this 'exchange' smart contract can call 'retire' method on the 'Manager' smart contract, the latter checks if the caller's address is in the 'authorized' list and then performs the requested action.

### Post-minting data enrichment for issued tokens

Projects should have ability to enrich the trust-chain of tokens with additional data in the form of VC/VP after the tokens have been created through editable metadata. Diagrammatically this should look like this:

```scss
VP1(VC1, VC2) <---- Token
                  /
VP2(VC3) <-------/ (edited) 
```

Where VP2 (VC3) have been linked to the token after the token have been minted.

It should be possible to specify, at minting time, that a particular token instance prohibits adding and/or removing of any information after the creation.

Probably depends on [https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-improvement-proposal/discussions/607](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-improvement-proposal/discussions/607), also visible here: [https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-657](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-657)

### Block and policy discoverability/search

* Introduce a capability into Guardian where a user can search, directly from the editor, examples of the usage of specific blocks
* The search scope should be inside a Guardian instance and, additionally, further through all published policies
* Uses should be able to preview the usage of the block without having to import policy into their Guardian instance
*   There should be additional filters in the UI that would allow users to restrict the scope of the search based on:

    * date range
    * SR (list)
    * Presence/absence of tags and their scoring (e.g. 'minimum 50 thumbs-up tags')
    * name

### Supply Chain and Macro Dynamics

Investigate and determine the rules that will govern supply chain and macro dynamics of a decentralized GHG data ecosystem. Key questions include but are not limited to:

* How will the use of offsets and RECs influence upstream and downstream emissions?
* How will the emissions of material inputs and intermediate products impact the emissions of final products?
* How will the emissions of final products impact scope 3 emissions of downstream customers?
* How can supply chain actors better coordinate data, approaches, and methodologies of emissions that are from the same source, but different scopes and categories throughout supply chains and product life cycles? &#x20;
* How can emissions be properly categorized, calculated, and allocated in a way that avoids double and under counting?
* As emissions are measured and calculated in real-time, how can corresponding inventories be updated?
* How can inventories be updated to reflect dynamic changes to supply chains and corporate structures?

Identify and implement new Guardian features that facilitate the necessary supply chain and macro-dynamics.

## ---- December 2023----

### Policy equivalence assessment based on their execution results for the same data

* Introduce the capability into the Guardian codebase to easily run 'test dataset' on a policy instance such that the results of the 'run' are also captured, saved and can be compared between runs. Such test runs should not have effect on the external persistent storage (Hedera, IPFS), i.e. this should be performed in the 'test-run' mode.
* Introduce the capability to capture the 'input' into the policy during its execution, in both the 'test-run' and the production operation mode. The 'input' should be saved into the DB, from which it can then be used for running the policy test as per above.
* It should be possible to export saved inputs and results.
* Replay the trust chain for an asset based on the public sources and see if the results (the issued assets) would've been the same.

## ---- January 2024----

### Implement discontinuing policy workflow

Implement the policy deprecation workflow which includes:

* Guardian UI allowing issuing SR to discontinue a policy (version) or the entire policy from a certain date (in the future or 'now').
* Policy grid should display a suitable marker against non-active policies, and a different for the ones soon expiring.
* An appropriate message posted in the corresponding Hedera topic recording the 'discontinuing' decision
* For in-progress projects that have been registered and are operating under the policy it should be possible to 'switch' to the appropriate version of the policy which is still valid.

### Business User Policy Development Feature

Business Analyst and Sustainability Consultants generally are less technical than developers. Although JSON is the most functional way to construct Guardian Policies, there may be more formal ways to integrate traditional business tool and rules validation capabilities to automatically compile policies.
