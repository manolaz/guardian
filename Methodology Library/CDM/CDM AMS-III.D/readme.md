## Introduction

In the pursuit of sustainable practices, AMS-III.D can be used as a methodology to reshape anaerobic manure management practices. The pressing global concern surrounding methane emissions and the environmental impact of livestock farming has prompted the development of this innovative strategy under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). By focusing on the modification or replacement of existing anaerobic systems and optimizing the recovery of methane, AMS-III.D sets a course to address greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and encourage efficient energy utilization.

The urgency to mitigate methane's potent contribution to climate change highlights the importance of using a methodology like AMS-III.D.
This methodology centers on anaerobic manure management systems in livestock farms by introducing ways to quantify the emissions and reductions from advanced technologies used for capturing, utilizing, and properly disposing of methane. When these technologies are not utilized, methane emissions from manure management can significantly contribute to the greenhouse effect. AMS-III.D considers the use of captured methane for energy or its responsible elimination through processes like flaring or combustion. This approach not only prevents methane from entering the atmosphere but also unlocks the potential to harness methane as a valuable energy source.

AMS-III.D's framework is enriched by the incorporation of several essential methodological tools, each designed to ensure accuracy and consistency in emission calculations. Referencing tools such as "Tool to calculate project or leakage CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion," "Tool to calculate baseline, project and/or leakage emissions from electricity consumption," "Tool to determine project emissions from flaring gases containing methane," and "Project and leakage emissions from anaerobic digesters," this methodology encapsulates the schemas and parameters necessary for precise assessments. These tools play a pivotal role in calculating baseline emissions, project emissions, leakage, and emission reductions, reinforcing the integrity of AMS-III.D as a comprehensive approach to sustainable manure management practices.

Significantly, AMS-III.D recognizes the environmental risks associated with conventional practices in instances where anaerobic digesters are not employed. In such cases, untreated manure can lead to substantial methane emissions, with far-reaching implications for the climate and local ecosystems. Methane, being a potent greenhouse gas, possesses a higher heat-trapping capacity than carbon dioxide over shorter periods. By adopting the methodologies outlined in AMS-III.D, which includes adhering to specific conditions and monitoring parameters, the release of methane into the environment can be mitigated. This methodology not only ensures the reduction of methane emissions but also demonstrates its commitment to sustainable development, merging environmental stewardship with innovative agricultural practices.

## Need and Use for the AMS-III.D Policy

Globally, the emission of methane – a potent greenhouse gas – from conventional manure management remains an urgent concern. Methane, often underestimated but with a significant impact on climate change, holds the capacity to trap heat in the atmosphere approximately 25 times more effectively than carbon dioxide over a century. This highlights the immediate need for methodologies like AMS-III.D to mitigate the profound influence of methane emissions on global warming.

Manure management practices, particularly within livestock farming, play a substantial role in methane emissions. When manure is improperly treated or left untreated, it undergoes anaerobic decomposition, releasing methane gas as a natural byproduct. This significantly contributes to the accumulation of atmospheric methane. Additionally, specific manure management systems, such as lagoons, provide an environment conducive to methane production due to the absence of oxygen during decomposition. These emissions amplify the environmental impact of the agriculture sector and contribute to the broader challenge of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.

In the context of modern emission reduction projects, the necessity for transparency and credibility is undeniable. The Guardian, a platform built on the Hedera Network, emerges as a solution to challenges like double counting and fraud. Hedera's distributed ledger technology ensures immutable and transparent record-keeping, thereby enhancing the accountability and integrity of emission reduction initiatives. As the Guardian platform streamlines processes, enhances accuracy, and fosters trust within clean manure management projects, AMS-III.D not only bolsters its environmental impact but also highlights the role of cutting-edge technology in propelling a greener, more sustainable future.

## Policy Guide

This policy is published to Hedera network and can either be imported via Github (.policy file) or IPSF timestamp. 

Policy: 1693223777.317635003

### Available Roles 
 
- Project Proponent - The project proponent is responsible for executing the emission reduction project. The project proponent must adhere to the requirements outlined by the CDM and provide evidence of the emission reductions achieved. Upon successful verification, the project proponent receives certified emission reduction (CER) tokens as an incentive for their emission reductions.
- Verification and Validation Body (VVB) - The VVB plays a critical role in independently verifying and validating the project data submitted by the project proponent. They thoroughly assess the project's emission reduction potential, methodologies, and adherence to the policy guidelines. Based on their evaluation, the VVB either approves or rejects the project for registration.
- Designated National Authority (DNA) - The DNA is a governmental body representing the country where the emission reduction project is being implemented. They review and approve the project's eligibility in accordance with national policies and regulations. The DNA's endorsement is essential for the project to proceed with the AMS-III.D policy.
- Registry (UNFCCC) - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) serves as the registry for the CDM. They oversee the multiple workflow steps involved in the project's approval, including the verification and validation process by the VVB and the endorsement by the DNA. The UNFCCC's approval is necessary for the project's successful registration and issuance of CER tokens
